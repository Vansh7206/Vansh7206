# 👋 Hi, I’m Vansh

**Data Analyst / ML Practitioner**  
I build end-to-end machine learning projects with a strong focus on **real-world decision making**, not just model accuracy.

---

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

- Design complete ML pipelines: **EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → deployment**
- Work with **imbalanced datasets** and tune models based on **business cost (FN vs FP trade-offs)**
- Build and deploy **interactive Streamlit applications** for ML predictions
- Translate model outputs into **clear, non-technical insights**

---

## 🧠 How I Think About ML

> I don’t optimize models for accuracy alone.  
> I optimize them for **impact, risk, and business outcomes**.

- Threshold tuning matters more than chasing +1% accuracy  
- A simple model well-explained beats a complex model no one understands  
- If a model can’t be deployed or explained, it’s not finished

### 🔹 45 Days of ML
- Consistent hands-on ML practice  
- Focus on fundamentals, experiments, and implementation  
- Learning by building, breaking, and fixing
